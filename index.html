                <p>Hi there! Test! My name is Nick Padley. By day, I work at <a href="http://www.cd2learning.com">CD2 Learning</a>, which is a single solution that provides a cloud-based learning architecture accessible using any mobile device at any time. Organizations can select from a combination of easy to use technology offerings to create a unique system that scales to any size for onboarding, collaboration, educating internal or external customers and more.</p>
                <p>After work, I take care of my family and spend some time working on this website. In addition, I serve as a choir director at a local church. You can usually find me in the loft Saturday evening and Sunday mornings. Finally, I enjoy staying healthy using various workouts. Check out a few at the <a href="http://neilarey.com/">NR Project</a>.</p>
