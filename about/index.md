My name is Nick Padley and I work in the online eLearning industry. Our company, [CD2 Learning][cd2] is working to help people move beyond the confines of a traditional LMS or LCMS and deliver truly astonishing results.

### How I Work

During the work day, I tend to spend a lot of time on the phone and instant messenger, talking to coworkers and accomplishing tasks. My primary job is to work in user experience design, front-end web development and software documentation.

In order to get my day done, I find the following tools indispensable:

### Work Tools

* Paper and pen for notes [see here][notes]
* [Omnifocus for tasks][omnifocus]
* [Evernote][evernote] for scanning my notes
* The standard Apple productivity suite (Mail, iCal and Messages)
* iTunes and [Songza][songza]
* [Pocket][pocket]
* [Zite] for research

### Code Tools
