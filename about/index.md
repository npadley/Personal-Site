My name is Nick Padley and I work in the online eLearning industry. I am primarily concerned with how to boost user engagement through making the online experience better. My primary job is to work in user experience design, front-end web development and software documentation.

### How I Work

I am a big fan of continuous learning methodologies. I always appreciate learning something new and increasing my knowledge of the world.

During the work day, I tend to spend a lot of time on the phone and instant messenger, talking to coworkers and accomplishing tasks. 

In order to get my day done, I find the following tools indispensable:

#### Work Tools

* Paper and pen for notes [see here][notes]
* [Omnifocus for tasks][omnifocus]
* [Evernote] and [Scanner Pro][spro] for scanning my notes
* The standard Apple productivity suite (Mail, iCal and Messages)
* iTunes and [iTunes Radio][itunes]
* [Pocket] for storing articles
* [Zite] for research

#### Code Tools
* [Safari Developer Tools](https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/)
* [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/)
* [Less](http://www.lesscss.org)
* [CoRD](http://cord.sourceforge.net/)
* [Sourcetree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

### Social Media Policy

I maintain presence on two social media networks: [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nickpadley) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nickpadley). Other than that, I have deactivated or deleted any other account. Doing this allows me to have a greater understanding of who has access to any information that I post. My Twitter profile is fully public, meaning that everyone has access to whatever I post there. This makes me think about what I want to share and whether I want to share it.

#### Things to Remember About Social

* When something is free, the user is the product
* Many social media companies place advertising revenue as priority
* Social networking can be a time suck
* If it's posted publicly, it's out of your control
