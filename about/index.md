My name is Nick Padley and I work in the online eLearning industry. I am primarily concerned with how to boost user engagement through making the online experience better. My primary job is to work in user experience design, front-end web development and software documentation.

### How I Work

I am a big fan of continuous learning methodologies. I always appreciate learning something new and increasing my knowledge of the world.

During the work day, I tend to spend a lot of time on the phone and instant messenger, talking to coworkers and accomplishing tasks. 

In order to get my day done, I find the following tools indispensable:

#### Work Tools

* Paper and pen for notes [see here][notes]
* [Omnifocus for tasks][omnifocus]
* [Evernote] and [Scanner Pro][spro] for scanning my notes
* The standard Apple productivity suite (Mail, iCal and Messages)
* iTunes and [iTunes Radio][itunes]
* [Pocket] for storing articles
* [Zite] for research

#### Code Tools
* [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/)
* [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/)
