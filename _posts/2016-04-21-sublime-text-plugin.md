title: Beyond Compare Sublime Text Plugin
---

I recently started using [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com) on my Mac and have found it to be a really useful utility. The one thing I couldn't find, however, was any way of linking the program with Sublime Text. 

What I wanted was to be able to have two files open in Sublime and be able to pass those files to BeyondCompare so that I can get a nice graphical comparison tool.

As a result, I found and modified a quick plugin to make this happen. You can find the [repository on Github](https://github.com/npadley/BeyondCompare), and it is available to install via [package control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/BeyondCompare).
