So, I've decided to switch my personal website over to using [Jekyll][1] rather than Wordpress. It seems that all the cool kids are doing it these days. Here are a few reasons that I decided to try this:

* I want to start learning Ruby
* The various Wordpress themes required too much customization
* I want to manage my blog with version control
* I don't need all the bells and whistles
* I'd rather have written the HTML, even if it is ugly

### Rebooting

Along with the change, I've also decided to reboot the blog portion of the site. Over the years, I've tried various content management systems. I started with Blogger and I also tried Typo3, Drupal and Joomla. I finally settled on Wordpress for hosting the site.

### Blog History

In looking at the various posts that I had put up since 2002, most of them would now qualify as a Twitter or Facebook update. In other words, it was primarily what was going on in my life at the time. I used this site to keep my family updated.

When blogs first started, it seems like many people didn't know what to do with them and treated them in the same manner - they were a personal space for journaling. At least, that was my understanding of how things were designed to work.

Over the years, blogs evolved from a personal space to official websites that deliver news, training, learning, etc... These days, a strong blog has value for people other than to see your personal updates. There are lots of other social services designed for that.

### Blog Direction

So, after looking at the various posts, I'm going to switch the direction of this blog. I'm going to start creating posts around a few initial topics:

* Hobbies, particularly board games
* Technology News
* Web Design and front-end coding

I'll be adding more topics as I go, but for the moment, I think these three areas will start adding value to my blog for people other than family. I'm really excited to start talking about board games, which is going to be the next post. It's a really exciting time to be a gamer (the non-electronic type) because of all the cool things happening in the board game industry.
