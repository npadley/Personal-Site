title: Switching to Sublime Text from Espresso
---

I recently switched my text editor of 5+ years to [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) from [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/). I've been learning the interface for the new editor and really like it. Listed below are a few reasons that compelled me to switch:

* Better plugin integration (Espresso sugars are neat, but support and configuration is limited)
* More plugins
* Better documentation
* Faster performance
* More configuration options
* Better support for file formats (It always was a pain to have to associate additional file formats in Espresso)
* Multiple cursors (I love the ability to select multiple locations in a doc and simultaneously update them)

I evaluated a number of other text editors on the way to my decision. Among the running was the [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) app. It's a great app and looks like it has a lot of potential. However, because I do a lot of work over FTP, their support of that protocol is a bit limited. As a result, I ended up landing on Sublime Text and have been very happy.

Finally, the last thing that convinced me to switch was a very nice, [free course provided by TutsPlus](https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/). This course is a very good 2 hour overview of the Sublime Text interface and what it can do. I highly recommend watching the videos and giving it a try for yourself.
