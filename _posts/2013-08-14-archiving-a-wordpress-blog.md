title: Archiving a Wordpress Blog

Now that I have moved off of Wordpress, I started looking for a way to archive the old posts in case I ever wanted to read through things again. Maybe it will be good bathroom reading.

To keep track of my personal journal, I use [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) which is a fantastic piece of software. It has high design values, lets you keep track of pictures and even will store geo-location and weather data.

Because Day One is such a great piece of software, I found out that it can import text files as entries. Up until today, I was trying to find a way to translate the XML file that Wordpress exports into text files so I could keep everything in one program. However, I think I've found a better solution.

### Turn Your Blog Into a Book

Doing some quick searching, I found a great site called [Blog Booker](http://www.blogbooker.com). It will take the XML export from your site and uses LATEX to typeset the book. It does a very good job of taking all your blog posts **including** all the links.

You can even take your book over to [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com) and have it professionally printed. I'll do this at some point.

So, as a result, I have a nicely formatted PDF file of the old posts that I can now read through at my own leisure and I don't have to worry about compatibility with Day One and importing all my old posts into there.
