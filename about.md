My name is Nick Padley and I work in as a Senior Program Manager at <a href="https://www.logile.com">Logile</a.>. I enjoy working on various forecasting and labor planning scenarios along with scheduling, time, and attendance. I have a passion for the voice of the customer and creating an engaging professional services environment.

### How I Work

I am a big fan of continuous learning. I always appreciate learning something new and increasing my knowledge of the world.

During the work day, I tend to spend a lot of time on the phone and chat, talking to coworkers and accomplishing tasks.

In order to get my day done, I find the following tools indispensable:

#### Work Tools

* Paper and pen for notes
* [Todoist][todo]
* [Onenote] and [Scanner Pro][spro] for scanning my notes
* The Microsoft Office Suite
* Apple Music
* [Pocket] for storing articles

#### Code Tools
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/)
* [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/)

### Social Media Policy

I maintain presence on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nickpadley). Other than that, I have deactivated or deleted most other accounts. Doing this allows me to have a greater understanding of who has access to any information that I post. This makes me think about what I want to share and whether I want to share it.

#### Things to Remember About Social

* When something is free, the user is the product
* Many social media companies place advertising revenue as priority
* Social networking can be a time suck
* If it's posted publicly, it's out of your control
